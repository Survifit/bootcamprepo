    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are obvious trends towards better performance for smaller schools (~95% passing overall in small-medium schools vs. ~76% passing overall in large schools), and, perhaps counterintuitively, smaller spending on a per-student basis (~95% passing overall for the two smallest budget ranges vs. ~77% passing overall for the two largest budget ranges). However, with this particular data set that just indicates a difference between charter and district schools. Looking at the summary by school there is only one charter school that is in the 'large' school category and only two charter schools that make it into the top half of the spending groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Looking at just the difference between charter and district schools there is a clear difference in both average scores and passing rates for students, with charter schools outperforming the district schools by roughly three points in average reading scores and by more than six points in average math scores leading to overall passing rates of 95% for charter schools and only 74% for district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next step for this analysis should look at standard deviations within the data for individual schools. It stands out that although charter schools only perform 3 points higher in reading, their reading pass rate is almost 16 points higher than the district schools and a 6 point edge in average math scores leads to more than 27 points difference in passing rate for math. This indicates a far smaller variance in scores for the charter schools and should be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming that the variance is smaller for the charter schools (noting variance should normally be higher for a smaller sample of a truly random population) it then needs to be determined whether this is due to selection effects (higher admittance standards or higher performing students choosing charter over district schools) or whether there are best practices in place at the charter schools that allow them to better assist low performing students, getting more of them to passing grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, it's interesting to note that, for both math and reading, performance tends to stay relatively stable (within a couple points) across all 4 years at all schools. Also, regardless of charter or district, students tend to perform better at reading than at math (although this is much more pronounced in the district scores).\n",
